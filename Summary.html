<h1>DOMAIN NAME SERVER</h1>
<p>
  Domain Name Server (DNS) is a standard protocol that helps internet users discover websites using human readable addresses.
  </p>
  <h2>Types of Domain</h2>
   <strong>1. Top-Level Domain:</strong> Top-level domains are at the top of the internet hierarchy of domain names. They are commonly referred to as TLDs. E.g of the TLDs are .com, .org, info, .website, .net, .Co etc.
   <br><br>
   <strong>2. Country Code Top Level Domain:</strong> ccTLD are country codes, Each country has its own ccTLD, but you don’t have to use one, just because you live in a specific country. For example, the ccTLD .co is for websites based out of Colombia, but it’s commonly used by internet startups, like AND.CO. These domain extensions can be useful if you’re building a website in a specific country and want to signal to your visitors that they’ve come to the right place. For example, websites based out of the US can use the ‘.us’ extension, while companies from Japan can use the ‘.jp’ extension.
   <br><br>
   <strong>3. Generic Top-Level Domains: </strong> gTLD is classified as a TLF as it refers to the type of use cases these domains are intended for.
   <br><br>
   <strong>4. Second-Level Domains:</strong> Second-level domains are below the TLDs in terms of hierarchy. It describes the second piece of the domain name, such as the ‘hostgator’ in ‘www.hostgator.com.’There are also country code second-level domains, which might look like the following:
• .co.uk – Companies in the United Kingdom commonly use this.
• .gov.uk – This is used by government agencies throughout the United Kingdom.
• .gov.au – Government agencies across Australia use this.
<br><br>
<strong>5. Third-Level Domains:</strong>Third level domains are below second-level domains in the domain name hierarchy. Eg, “www.hostgator.com,” ‘www’ would be the third level domain. Or, if you’re using a subdomain to build an additional section of your site, this would be a third-level domain as well. The main reason for using a third-level domain is when you’re adding a subdomain to your existing domain.
<br>Common purposes of Subdomains are seen below:
<ul>
  <li>Adding a blog. You can host your blog on a subdomain like ‘blog.mysite.com,’ to create a separate content hub.</li>
  <li>Creating a resource section. If you have a resource, tutorial, or support section, you can host this on a subdomain like ‘support.mysite.com.’</li>
 <li>Hosting an app. If you have a web-based app, you can use a subdomain like ‘app.mysite.com.’</li>
<li>Creating an online store. Online stores require different software, programs, and security protocols. Instead of applying this to your entire site, you can use a subdomain like ‘store.mysite.com’ to run your storefront.</li>
</ul>
<h5>KEY FACTORS OF CHOOSING A DOMAIN</h5>
   <strong>1.It should align with website goals:</strong> Think about what kind of website you’re building and choose an extension that aligns with your topic and overall goals.</li>
   <br><br>
   <strong>2.Go for something common:</strong>It's better to go for a common domain name extension if it's your first time creating a site.
   <br><br>
   <strong>1. Pick up related extensions:</strong> When you find the domain name with the ‘.com’ extension, register it and also pick up all of the related extensions. Then, forward all of the different extensions to your primary domain. That way if someone guesses the wrong extension they’ll still be taken to your website. 
   <h5>DOMAIN SUFFIX</h5>
 The "dot.com" really refers to the domain of a Web site. Sites on the Web are grouped by their URLs according to the type of organization providing the information on the site. The domain suffix provides you with a clue about the purpose or audience of a Web site. The domain suffix might also give you a clue about the geographic origin of a Web site. Many sites from the United Kingdom will have a domain suffix of .uk. Examples are .com, .edu, .gov, .org, .net. 
 <h5><center>THE WORLD WIDE WEB</center></h5>
  The Web gives users access to a vast array of documents that are connected to each other by means of hypertext or hypermedia links—i.e., hyperlinks, electronic connections that link related pieces of information in order to allow a user easy access to them. Hypertext allows the user to select a word or phrase from text and thereby access other documents that contain additional information pertaining to that word or phrase. Hypermedia documents feature links to images, sounds, animations, and movies. The Web operates within the Internet’s basic client-server format; servers are computer programs that store and transmit documents to other computers on the network when asked to, while clients are programs that request documents from a server as the user asks for them. Browser software allows users to view the retrieved documents. A hypertext document with its corresponding text and hyperlinks is written in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and is assigned an online address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).
<h5>Working of a WWW</h5>
The WWW is based on several different technologies: Web browsers, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
<h5 >Features of WWW:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Hypertext Information System</li>
  <li>Cross platform</li>
  <li>Distributed</li>
  <li>Open standards and open source</li>
  <li>Uses Web browser to provide a single interface for many Servers</li>
  <li>Dynamic, Interactive and Evolving</li>
</ul>
<h5>Components of the WEB:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Uniform Resource Locator (URL): serves as system for resources on web.</li>
<li>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP): specifies communication of browser and server.</li>
<li>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML): defines structure, organisation and content of webpage.</li>
</ol>
<h5>UNDERSTANDING URLS</h5>
<b>Sheme</b>
<p>
 Every URL begins with the scheme. This tells your browser what type of address it is so the browser connects to it correctly. There are many types of schemes, but for typical web browsing you will mostly see http and https.
 </p>
 <b>Domain Name</b>
 <p>
   The domain name is the most prominent part of a web address. Typically, different pages on the same site will continue to use the same domain name. For example, all pages on this site share the GCFLearnFree.org domain name.Each segment of the domain name separated by a period is called a domain. The domain on the right is called a top-level domain, with the domain to the left of it called the second-level domain, then third-level domain, and so on. You can often learn something about the site from the domains. One of the domains usually identifies the organization, while the top-level domain may give you more general information on what kind of site it is. 
 </p>
 <b>File Path</b>
<p>
  The file path often called the path tells your browser to load a specific page. If you don’t specify a path and only enter a domain name, your browser is still loading a specific page; it’s just loading a default page, which usually will help you navigate to other pages. URLs that end with the domain name without a file path usually will load a homepage or an index page that's designed to help you navigate to specific pages on the site.
  </p>
  <b>Anchor</b>
 <p>
    Also appearing after the path, the anchor tells your browser to scroll to or load a specific part of the page. The anchor begins with a hashtag and is used to direct your browser to a specific part of a very long page.
